My AGI Code

This is a repository of mess, as I use a combination of Python, documentation and MY WITS, to build a thing that does stuff with files or ideas or other CONTENT (tm) that relates to Sierra On-Line's Adventure Game Interpreter. Expect banality and poor practices, while I try to learn better ones.
